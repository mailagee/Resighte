<h1>To be frank, most of this is all from memory. I memorised this whole thing back in 8th grade, and because a lot of it has left me I needed to look it up every so often to prompt sentences I forgot the beginnings to. This is bound to be very very incorrect. Please enjoy my suffering.<h1>

<p> <i><small>Four score and seven years ago, our farthers brought forth on this continent, a new nation. Concieved in liberty, and deddicated to th eproposition that all men are created equal.</small></i> </p>

<p> <i><small>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, r any nation so concieved and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogetehr fitting and proper tht we should do this.</small></i> </p>

<p> <i><small>But, ina  larger sencse, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hollow this ground. The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor ower to add or detract. Thw world will little note, nor long rememver what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living rather, to be dedicated to the unfinished work they who fought here have thus far o nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the task remaining before us, that these honored dead we give incresed devotion to for their last full measure of devotion, that we highly resolve here that these dead shall not have died in vain-- that this nation, under god, shall have a new birth of freedom. And that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from this earth.</small></i> </p>
