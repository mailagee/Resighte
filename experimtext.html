  <p>A bunch of paragraph stuff here. Writing is great and have I told you about my bro Dude? He's great and I might name him <sup>Officer Bastion Buster Backsir.</sup></p>

<!-- Yhe sup tooks like somebody saying sup I'm this, and I find it very amusing. I really want to go and capitalize and punctuate properly things. Edit: I have gone back and capitalized things tha should be capitalized -->

<p class="squeegie"><strong>I have created a monstrosity of Spongebob</strong> <i>lamao.</i> I was bored at work and tried to draw him from memory <em>and it's very creepy looking.</em> Anyways, <ins>I decided to take that sucker and tape it to an obscure spot in the back for whoever works today to eventually find.</ins></p>

<!-- Shameless plug right here, go listen to (or check out) Convent Bonfires. They're on Youtube and Spotify and make really snazzy music. 10/10 would reccommend. If you like catchy groovy songs this groups good for you -->

<p>Got a few months of road behind me, no one place has been able to define me. And I still got an accent--talking to my family, <small>(talking to my family.)</small> Bear went bad in <span class="statei">Missisippi-</span>- outside an Arbys' looking like a hippie, <mark>no shoes and a broke down car--backpack and two guitars.</mark> The car still shakes when I hit thirty, Texas come and did me dirty. and thats okay yeah, thats alright, I'm still kicking I'm still alive.</p>

<!-- My personal favorite is Road Trip, which is why all the text is quoting it. But there's a lot of other songs like Shame Limbo, I Believe, and Expectations, all of which I thourooughy enjoy. There's more than that too though like Shaky Hands which I don't remember so I can't give a review on it. but like, if you see this do check them out. -->

<!-- Don't come at me for the lyrical arrangement. I am not good at comprehension and I didn't look any of them up so they might be wacky. Comments are fun. Also. Protip. Do not try and pet a snapping turtle. -->
